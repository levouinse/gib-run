## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-02

### 🔒 Security Fixes

**Critical:**
- **Fixed IP spoofing vulnerability in rate limiter** - Added `trustProxy` option (default: false) to prevent attackers from bypassing rate limits via `x-forwarded-for` header spoofing
- **Fixed password storage in share manager** - Passwords now hashed with SHA-256 before storage, preventing plaintext exposure in memory dumps

**High:**
- Improved timing attack resistance in share link validation using pre-computed hashes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Critical:**
- **Fixed memory leak in logger middleware** - Added proper stream cleanup on process exit
- **Fixed watcher infinite restart loop** - Added restart counter (max 3 attempts) to prevent infinite recovery loops on ENOSPC errors
- **Fixed SPA middleware duplication** - Unified 3 different SPA implementations into single consistent behavior

**High:**
- Fixed process runner memory leak - Added cleanup handlers for process logs array
- Fixed inconsistent error handling in hooks - Now uses centralized logger
- Fixed stream leak in logger middleware - Proper cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

- Optimized share manager cleanup - Use Array.from to avoid iterator issues during Map deletion
- Reduced port check timeout from 2s to 500ms for faster startup
- Moved URL require outside hot path in staticServer for better performance

### 🔧 Code Quality

**Eliminated Duplications:**
- Removed duplicate `getTimestamp()` function (3 instances → 1 centralized)
- Removed duplicate `escapeHtml()` function (2 instances → 1 centralized)
- Removed duplicate logger timestamp method - now uses centralized utility
- Unified SPA middleware implementations (3 different → 1 consistent)

**Improvements:**
- Added atomic lock for shutdown to prevent race conditions
- Added cleanup timers for move detection Map to prevent memory leaks
